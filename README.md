# **Machine Learning Models - Mathematical and Analytical Approach**  

This repository contains a series of Machine Learning model implementations in which we analyze their behavior from a **mathematical perspective**, evaluating key parameters and output metrics such as **accuracy, exactitude, precision, and confusion matrix**.  

## **Repository Content**  

In this course, we explore different Machine Learning algorithms and models, focusing on their mathematical formulation and evaluation methods. The analyzed models include:  

- **Decision Trees (`TreeDecision`)**: We evaluate the structure of decision trees and their splitting criteria based on entropy and information gain.  
- **Bayes’ Theorem and Naïve Inference (`TheoremNaiveBayes`)**: Implementation and analysis of the Naïve Bayes classifier, considering its probabilistic foundation.  
- **ROC Curves and Evaluation Metrics (`ROCurvesMetrics`)**: Study of the ROC curve and its interpretation through AUC, along with key metrics for model validation.  
- **Linear Regression for Apartment Price Prediction (`RegressionLinearApartments`)**: Implementation of linear regression to predict real estate prices, examining coefficients and model fit through Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
- **Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (`MultilayerPerceptronNeuralNetworks`)**: Application of MLPs with backpropagation, exploring the impact of activation functions and learning rates.  
- **Linear Regression for Gasoline Consumption (`ModelLinearRegressionGasolineConsumption`)**: Regression analysis to model gasoline consumption based on different explanatory variables.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (`KNeighborsClassifierKNN`)**: Implementation of the KNN model, analyzing Euclidean distance and its impact on classification.  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (`ConvolutionalNetworksCNNs`)**: Study of CNNs applied to image recognition, understanding filters, pooling layers, and training processes.  

## **Mathematical Approach and Model Evaluation**  

Each model has been evaluated not only in terms of computational implementation but also through its mathematical formulation and behavior on different datasets. We have conducted detailed studies of:  

- **Internal parameters**: Coefficients, weights, and activation functions.  
- **Output metrics**: Accuracy, exactitude, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  
- **Performance curves**: Model evaluation using ROC curves and decision threshold analysis.  

## **Conclusion**  

This repository serves as a collection of our explorations in Machine Learning from both theoretical and practical perspectives, providing code, analysis, and visualizations of each model in action.
